  Hello! I'm Josh, a Software Engineer specializing in Cloud Architecture and Full-Stack Development.
  
  I thrive on building scalable systems. Currently, I engineer healthcare solutions at Mayo Clinic, utilizing Angular, C#, and MongoDB to build resilient microservices on GCP. I also serve as a security champion and library architect for my division.
  
  My background balances deep industry experience with academic research:
  
  - **Industry**: I've designed genomic processing systems at Ancestry, built high-volume event platforms at State Farm, and managed infrastructure at Micron.
  
  - **Research**: As a researcher at Purdue University, I've published peer-reviewed papers, managed AWS environments, and built ETL pipelines analyzing over 20 million jobs for the FRESCO project.
  
  I am most at home working with <mark>AWS</mark>, <mark>GCP</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>.NET</mark>, and <mark>Terraform</mark>.

          Core full-stack engineer building a healthcare specimen management web application using Angular (frontend), C# microservices (backend), and MongoDB. I designed a reference architecture for collaborative order locking on GCP using Cloud Run and Memorystore (Redis HA), enabling optimistic locking and prioritizing extensibility, maintainability, high availability, and cost-aware capacity planning. I am the sole author of rls-nuget-orders-locker, a modular .NET library defining order-locking domain contracts with DI-ready APIs and thorough unit tests. I also serve as the security champion for mcs-products-mono-ui, a three-team monorepo, establishing Veracode SAST/SCA scanning cadence and ensuring continuous compliance across shared dependencies.
