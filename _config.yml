  Hello! My name is Josh, and I enjoy creating things with code. My interest in software started while working on a second bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. Part of the Electrical Engineering curriculum included two Computer Science courses. After the first course in CS, I was hooked! I switched my major to Computer Science and completed a second bachelor's degree from Oregon State University. From November 2018 to August 2022 I was a DevOps Software Engineer at Micron working with a wide variety of technologies. I'm now at State Farm as a Full Stack Software Engineer building an asynchronous event driven microservices platform hosted on AWS that will process ~300k events per day.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>

          This was my senior project at Oregon State University. Along with a team of two other people, we created the OPaL language compiler. OPaL is a dynamically typed language inspired by Python and C, and its compiler is written in C. The compiler produces assembly code modeled after Java byte-code using a single address stack machine.
