  Hi, my name's Josh and I'm a backend Software Engineer. All of the services I've built at State Farm run on AWS, and they all use Python. My experience at Micron involved a mix of on and off prem services, mostly using C#, Java, and Perl.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>

          This was my senior project at Oregon State University. Along with a team of two other people, we created the OPaL language compiler. OPaL is a dynamically typed language inspired by Python and C, and its compiler is written in C. The compiler produces assembly code modeled after Java byte-code using a single address stack machine.

            I worked as a Software Engineer at Micron Technology for just under 4 years. I was responsible for developing and maintaining applications hosted on AWS. I also built and maintained CI/CD pipelines, participated in code reviews, customer requirements meetings, architecture design, and unit test reviews. I have experience creating and using telemetry and metrics to drive operational excellence (Splunk).
