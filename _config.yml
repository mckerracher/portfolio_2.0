  Hello! My name is Josh, and I'm a dedicated software engineer with a strong inclination towards coding and technology. My journey in the software realm began during my pursuit of a second bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I was introduced to Computer Science. The intellectual challenge and creative possibilities offered by the first course in Computer Science captivated me, prompting a shift in my academic focus. I subsequently completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University. 
  
  Currently, I am employed at Mayo Clinic as a Software Engineer on the PEaRLS Specimen Accessioning development team. I work as a core full-stack engineer across multiple code repositories, designing reference architectures for collaborative systems on GCP using Cloud Run and Memorystore (Redis). I am also the sole author of rls-nuget-orders-locker, a modular .NET library for order-locking domain contracts, and serve as the security champion for a three-team monorepo.
  
  Previously, I worked at Ancestry on the Genomic Algorithms team, designing cloud-scale systems to process and analyze genomic data on AWS. Before that, I spent about a year and a half at State Farm building an event-driven microservices platform that processes approximately 300,000 events per day. My first position after graduating was at Micron, where I managed 200+ RedHat Linux production servers and designed monitoring solutions.
  
  I also continue to hold a part-time position as a Software Engineer at Purdue University's Dependable Computing Systems Laboratory. Here, I lead research on the FRESCO project, which has resulted in two publications. I designed an ETL pipeline processing 20.9M HPC jobs and built the FRESCO data access and visualization platform at <mark>www.frescodata.xyz</mark>. I also serve as the sole administrator for AWS infrastructure for the DCSL research lab.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark>, <mark>GCP</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>.NET</mark>, and <mark>Terraform</mark>.

          As part of the website development process, it was discovered that an API was needed to expose the FRESCO database to the website via API calls. The website needed a way to query the database directly on this page: https://www.frescodata.xyz/simple-repository-search/

          As a core full-stack engineer on the PEaRLS Specimen Accessioning development team, I contribute across multiple code repositories (frontend and backend). I designed a reference architecture for collaborative order locking on GCP using Cloud Run and Memorystore (Redis HA), enabling optimistic locking and prioritizing extensibility, maintainability, high availability, and cost-aware capacity planning. I am the sole author of rls-nuget-orders-locker, a modular .NET library defining order-locking domain contracts with DI-ready APIs and thorough unit tests. I also serve as the security champion for mcs-products-mono-ui, a three-team monorepo, establishing Veracode SAST/SCA scanning cadence and ensuring continuous compliance across shared dependencies.
