  Hello! My name is Josh, and I'm a dedicated software engineer with a strong inclination towards coding and technology. My journey in the software realm began during my pursuit of a second bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I was introduced to Computer Science. The intellectual challenge and creative possibilities offered by the first course in Computer Science captivated me, prompting a shift in my academic focus. I subsequently completed a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University. 
  
  My first position as a Software Engineer after graduating was at Micron, where I gained experience working with a diverse range of technologies. After Micron, I spent about a year and a half at State Farm building a new event driven application using a microservices architecture on AWS (Python/Terraform) that processes about 300,000 events per day. Currently, I am employed at Ancestry as a Software Engineer on the Genomic Algorithms team, which is a 100% backend team. My team is responsible for the backend processes that make up the Ancestry DNA processing pipeline. Using Nextflow, Python, Terraform, Docker, and other tools on AWS, this pipeline processes thousands of new DNA samples per day, matching them against the 23 million samples currently in Ancestry's databases. My role in this team is to both maintain existing features and develop new ones. 
  
  I also continue to hold a part-time position as a Software Engineer at Purdue University's Dependable Computing Systems Laboratory. Here, I have been involved in the FRESCO project, utilizing tools and technologies such as Python, FastAPI, Django, Docker, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, and JupyterHub. My central responsibility has been to enhance the ability to analyze large sets of data representing supercomputer resource usage (the FRESCO project). I created a website for this project, which can be found at <mark>www.frescodata.xyz</mark>. Using FastAPI, I created an API that allows this website to securely read from the FRESCO database. I have also helped create a PostgreSQL Timescale DB for efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I have helped set up a Kubernetes cluster to host a JupyterHub instance, enabling public access to and analysis of data. I also take pride in advising and mentoring students involved in the project, fostering a collaborative and educational environment. 
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Terraform</mark>, and <mark>Java</mark>.

          At Purdue as a Software Engineer, I have been actively involved in the FRESCO project, leveraging technologies such as Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, and JupyterHub. My primary responsibility was to oversee and create the tools and infrastructure used to analyze large anonymized data sets representing supercomputer resource usage. I have successfully created a website for this project using Python Django (www.frescodata.xyz). I have also helped create a PostgreSQL Timescale database for optimal data storage and retrieval, and established a Kubernetes cluster to host a JupyterHub instance, allowing public access and analysis of data. In addition, I played a role in advising and mentoring students involved in the project, cultivating a collaborative and educational environment.
