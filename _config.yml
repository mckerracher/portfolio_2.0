  Hello! My name is Josh, and I'm a dedicated software engineer with a strong inclination towards coding and technology. My journey in the software realm began during my pursuit of a second bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I was introduced to Computer Science. The intellectual challenge and creative possibilities offered by the first course in Computer Science captivated me, prompting a shift in my academic focus. I subsequently completed a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University.
  
  Between November 2018 and August 2022, I held the position of Software Engineer at Micron, where I gained extensive experience working with a diverse range of technologies. Currently, I am employed at State Farm as a Software Engineer, where I was instrumental in building an asynchronous, event-driven microservices platform hosted on AWS, which processes approximately 300,000 events per day.
  
  In parallel, I also hold a part-time position as a Software Engineer at Purdue University's Dependable Computing Systems Laboratory. Here, I have been involved in several projects, utilizing tools and technologies such as Python, AWS, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, and JupyterHub. My central responsibility has been to enhance the ability to analyze large sets of data representing the 'Anvil' supercomputer resource usage. I have automated the ETL process from data creation to storage, ensured data privacy and security through anonymization, and created a PostgreSQL Timescale DB for efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I have set up a Kubernetes cluster to host a JupyterHub instance, enabling public access to and analysis of data. I also take pride in advising and mentoring students involved in the project, fostering a collaborative and educational environment.
  
  My commitment to continuous learning and improvement drives me to explore new technologies and methodologies, ensuring that I remain at the forefront of the rapidly evolving software industry.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark>,<mark>Python</mark>, and <mark>Java</mark>

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This was my senior project at Oregon State University. Along with a team of two other people, we created the OPaL language compiler. OPaL is a dynamically typed language inspired by Python and C, and its compiler is written in C. The compiler produces assembly code modeled after Java byte-code using a single address stack machine.
